One day I will refactor this project so it's not just one large file and it is easier to build on this platform with more modular code bits. 
But for now, this is the monstrosity that I have before us so far.

If you like to play with code, branch off, have fun. I'll add comments to explain the code to make it easier for anyone whose interested.
